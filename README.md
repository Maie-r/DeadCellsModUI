# Planned Features

## Weapons Page

In the aplication, the Weapons page is where you change the data from weapons and items, which can be selected by a list (read from the datascp file from res.pak)<br>
For each weapon, you can:
* Change the color it scales with (Brutality, Tactics, Survival, or a combination of them)
* Change the base price of the item sold in shops
* Change the Legendary Affix (*can be limited for some effects)
* Change the Tags (Will affect what mutations, affixes, etc. can be attached to the weapon)
* View each attack from the weapon's combo (selectable by its tabs)
* Change the selected attack's Damage, Crit Multipler, Cooldown, Delay, Hit Frame, Hitbox, Sounds and Sprites
* View the attack animation in motion
* View the full combo animation in motion
* Change aditional properties (very limited, changing crit condition is not possible)

For each item, you can:
* Change the color it scales with (Brutality, Tactics, Survival, or a combination of them)
* Change the damage of the item, if it has damage
* Change the cooldown of the item

## Affixes

## Blueprints

To change Blueprint spawning behavior, such as the percentage an enemy will have a blueprint in the level.

## Hero

To change base values for the beheaded, such as jump height, speed, health, etc. Can be very risky to change
